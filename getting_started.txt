The process for designing an OO program:

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.
2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs into nouns and do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.
3. Optional - when you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
